        <p> Meraki is a word that modern Greeks often use to describe doing something with soul, creativity, or love - when you
            put
            <i>"something of yourself"</i> into what you're doing, whatever it may be. This word inspired us to develop a website,
            in order to help you organize your life and stay productive. From creating lists of tasks to projects that you
            can share with people. It's a website thoughtfully designed, beautifully crafted to be simple, clean and easy
            to use.

            This project was developed for the Web Languages and Technologies (LTW) class of the Master in Informatics and Computer Engineering
            (MIEIC) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP), by Bárbara Sofia Silva, Julieta Frade
            and Luís Martins in 2017.
